"""
MLR/DoE utility modules for ChemometricSolutions

TO BE IMPLEMENTED: Extract functions from mlr_doe.py and organize into:
- mlr_calculations.py: Model fitting and prediction
- mlr_diagnostics.py: VIF, lack of fit, replicates
- doe_utils.py: Design of experiments utilities

See REFACTORING.md for detailed migration guide.
