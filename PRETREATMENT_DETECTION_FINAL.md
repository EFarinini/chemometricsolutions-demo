# PCA Quality Control - Pretreatment Detection (Simplified Implementation)

## Overview

**Simple, informational pretreatment tracking** for the PCA Quality Control module.

**Key Principle**: PCA already handles centering/scaling with training statistics correctly. We just need to **detect and display** which spectral pretreatments (SNV, derivatives, etc.) were applied so users can apply them to test data.

## What This Does

### ✅ Simple Detection and Display

1. **Model Training Tab**: Detects which pretreatments were applied to training data and displays them
2. **Testing & Monitoring Tab**: Warns users if test data needs the same pretreatments
3. **That's It**: No complex statistics saving, no automatic application

### Why This Approach?

**PCA Already Handles Preprocessing Correctly:**
- The "Center only" and "Center + Scale (Auto)" options already use training statistics
- When projecting test data, PCA automatically applies training mean/std
- ✅ This works perfectly without any additional code!

**What Users Need To Do:**
- Apply spectral pretreatments (SNV, derivatives, etc.) to test data manually
- Use the Transformations page with the same parameters
- PCA will handle the rest

---

## Implementation

### 1. New Module: `pca_utils/pca_pretreatments.py`

**Simple class for detection:**

```python
class PretreatmentInfo:
    """Detect and display pretreatments - INFORMATIONAL ONLY"""

    def detect_pretreatments(dataset_name, transformation_history) -> bool
        """Detect which pretreatments were applied"""

    def get_summary() -> dict
        """Get summary of detected pretreatments"""
```

**Helper functions:**

```python
def detect_pretreatments(dataset_name, transformation_history) -> PretreatmentInfo
    """Convenience function to detect pretreatments"""

def display_pretreatment_info(pretreat_info, context="training")
    """Display pretreatment info in Streamlit UI"""

def display_pretreatment_warning(training_pretreat, test_dataset_name)
    """Display warning about pretreatment requirements"""
```

### 2. Model Training Tab Integration

**Location**: `pca_monitoring_page.py:876-898`

**What it does:**
```python
# Detect pretreatments from transformation history
pretreat_info = detect_pretreatments(current_dataset_name, transformation_history)

if pretreat_info:
    display_pretreatment_info(pretreat_info, context="training")
    # Shows:
    # ✅ Pretreatments detected: 1 transformation(s)
    #    • SNV (Standard Normal Variate)
    #    • Type: row_transformation
    #    • Column range: 5 to 104
    # 💡 Note: PCA's centering/scaling will use training statistics automatically
    # ⚠️ Important: Test data must have the same pretreatment applied!
```

### 3. Testing & Monitoring Tab Integration

**Location**: `pca_monitoring_page.py:1476-1486`

**What it does:**
```python
# Check if pretreatments were applied to training
training_pretreat_info = st.session_state.get('pca_monitor_pretreat_info')

if training_pretreat_info:
    display_pretreatment_warning(training_pretreat_info, test_dataset_name)
    # Shows side-by-side comparison:
    # Training pretreatments | Test dataset
    # ✓ SNV                 | ❌ No pretreatments detected
    # Plus: Instructions on how to apply
```

## User Workflow

### Complete Example

**1. Apply Transformation** (Transformations page):
```
User loads NIR_Data.csv
→ Applies SNV transformation
→ Saves as NIR_Data.snv
```

**2. Train Model** (Quality Control - Model Training tab):
```
User selects NIR_Data.snv
→ System detects: "SNV applied"
→ Displays warning: "Test data must have same pretreatment"
→ Trains PCA model
→ PCA centering/scaling uses training statistics automatically ✅
```

**3. Prepare Test Data** (Transformations page):
```
User loads Test_Set.csv
→ Applies SNV transformation (same parameters!)
→ Saves as Test_Set.snv
```

**4. Test Model** (Quality Control - Testing & Monitoring tab):
```
User selects Test_Set.snv
→ System compares:
   Training: ✓ SNV
   Test: ✓ SNV
→ Shows: "✅ Pretreatments match!"
→ Projects test data onto model
→ Results are valid ✅
```

## What Changed From Complex Version

### Before (Too Complex):
- ❌ Tried to save training statistics for every transformation
- ❌ Tried to automatically apply transformations to test data
- ❌ Complex logic for finding original data
- ❌ Risk of errors in automatic application

### Now (Simple and Correct):
- ✅ Just detects which pretreatments were applied
- ✅ Displays clear warnings and instructions
- ✅ Users apply transformations manually (more control)
- ✅ PCA's own preprocessing already works correctly
- ✅ Much simpler code, easier to maintain

---

## Technical Details

### What Gets Detected

The system tracks transformations from `st.session_state.transformation_history`:

**Row Transformations** (spectral pretreatments):
- SNV (Standard Normal Variate)
- First/Second Derivatives
- Savitzky-Golay
- Moving Average
- Row Sum = 100
- Binning

**Column Transformations**:
- Centering
- Autoscaling
- Scaling
- Range [0,1]
- Range [-1,1] (DoE Coding)
- Maximum = 100
- Sum = 100
- Log transformations

### Display Information

For each detected pretreatment:
- Transformation name
- Transformation type (row/column)
- Parameters (window size, polynomial order, etc.)
- Column range applied
- Timestamp

### User Guidance

The system provides:
- ✅ Clear detection messages
- ⚠️ Warnings when pretreatments don't match
- 📖 Step-by-step instructions on how to apply pretreatments
- 💡 Reminders that PCA handles centering/scaling automatically

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to debug

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Detection Works:**
- Load transformed data (e.g., SNV)
- Train model
- Verify pretreatment is detected and displayed

✅ **Warning Works:**
- Select test data without same pretreatment
- Verify warning message appears
- Verify instructions are shown

✅ **Match Detection:**
- Apply same pretreatment to test data
- Select test data
- Verify "✅ Pretreatments match" message

✅ **PCA Preprocessing:**
- Use "Center + Scale" option
- Verify test data uses training statistics
- Check T²/Q values are correct

## Summary

### What Was Accomplished

✅ **Simple pretreatment detection** - Detects transformations from transformation_history
✅ **Clear user feedback** - Shows which pretreatments were applied
✅ **Helpful warnings** - Alerts users when test data needs preprocessing
✅ **Step-by-step instructions** - Guides users on how to apply pretreatments
✅ **Maintains user control** - Users apply transformations manually
✅ **Clean implementation** - Only 240 lines, easy to maintain

### Key Insight

**The PCA module already does the hard part correctly** (using training statistics for centering/scaling). We just needed to add **visibility and guidance** for spectral pretreatments that users need to apply manually.

### Result

A simple, maintainable solution that:
- ✅ Ensures users apply correct pretreatments
- ✅ Provides clear guidance
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with PCA's existing preprocessing
- ✅ Gives users full control
- ✅ Is easy to understand and extend
