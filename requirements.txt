# - All versions are tested and compatible with Streamlit Cloud
# - Minimum Python version: 3.8
# - For local development, consider creating a virtual environment:
#   python -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
# - To update: pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
