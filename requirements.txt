# ChemometricSolutions - Comprehensive Requirements
# Complete interactive demos for chemometric analysis
# Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

# ===== CORE FRAMEWORK =====
streamlit>=1.28.0              # Web app framework
streamlit-aggrid>=0.3.0        # Advanced tables for data display
streamlit-plotly-events>=0.0.6 # Interactive Plotly charts

# ===== DATA MANIPULATION & ANALYSIS =====
pandas>=1.5.0                  # Data structures and manipulation
numpy>=1.23.0                  # Numerical computing
scipy==1.10.1                  # Scientific computing (PINNED - has pre-compiled wheels, compatible with GPy)

# ===== VISUALIZATION =====
plotly>=5.0.0                  # Interactive plots (main visualization library)
plotly-express>=0.4.1          # High-level Plotly interface (usually with plotly)
matplotlib>=3.5.0              # Static plotting (fallback/compatibility)
seaborn>=0.11.0                # Statistical visualization

# ===== MACHINE LEARNING & STATISTICS =====
scikit-learn>=1.0.0            # ML algorithms (classification, preprocessing)
statsmodels==0.14.0            # Advanced statistical models (PINNED - avoid Cython compilation)

# ===== DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS & OPTIMIZATION =====
pyDOE>=0.3.8                   # Design of Experiments (Plackett-Burman, Factorial, etc.)
GPy==1.13.2                    # Gaussian Process Regression (PINNED - requires scipy<1.12)
gpyopt==1.2.6                  # Bayesian Optimization (PINNED for stability)

# ===== FILE HANDLING =====
openpyxl>=3.0.9                # Excel file writing (.xlsx)
xlrd>=2.0.1                    # Excel file reading (.xls, .xlsx legacy)

# ===== MODEL PERSISTENCE =====
joblib>=1.2.0                  # Model serialization and parallel computing

# ===== DEVELOPMENT & DEBUGGING (Optional) =====
# Uncomment for development:
# pytest>=7.0.0                # Testing framework
# black>=22.0.0                # Code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0                # Linting

# ===== CRITICAL FIXES FOR STREAMLIT CLOUD =====
# Line 13: scipy==1.10.1 - PINNED to version with pre-compiled wheels
#          - scipy 1.11.4 and 1.12.0 fail to compile (no gfortran)
#          - scipy 1.10.1 has pre-built wheels for all platforms
#          - Still compatible with GPy 1.13.2 (requires scipy<1.12)
# 
# Line 23: statsmodels==0.14.0 - PINNED to avoid Cython compilation
#          Version 0.14.2+ fails to compile from source on cloud
#
# Line 26-28: GPy and gpyopt PINNED for compatibility
#
# All versions tested and compatible with Streamlit Cloud (Python 3.13)
